# NGS-Training-2021
The repository contains materials used in the Next Generation Training by H3ABioNet for 2021
Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become an essential tool in genetic and genomic analysis. It is increasingly important for experimental scientists to gain the bioinformatics skills required to analyse the large volumes of data produced by next generation sequencers. This course Equipped me with the essential informatics skills required to begin analysing NGS data and apply some of the most commonly used tools and resources for sequence data analysis.

The programme  covered prominent sequencing technologies, algorithmic theory and principles of bioinformatics, with a strong focus on practical computational sessions using sequence analysis techniques and tools applicable to any species or genome size. A variety of applications were covered from post-sequencing analysis - QC, alignment, assembly, variant calling and RNA-Seq..
